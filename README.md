# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this application because I wanted to quickly learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to learn these basics in an active way. This method allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the topics themselves because rather than just reading about them individually, I was able to actually build a simple web application that incorporated elements from each of the four topics. The web application itself is a tool that I can use to do even more studying on each of the four topics. I learned the basics of creating a framework of a website through the HTML document, adding style by using CSS, and adding basic interactivity with JavaScript. I also learned the basics of Git Bash and version control by using Git Bash commands to create feature branches and push changes to GitHub.

Each section contains notes for HTML, CSS, Git, or JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
